\title{Functional Redundancy}
\usage{
funredun(spDat, funDat, method = "bray", redund = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{spDat}{Data frame with rows as sites, columns as species, and elements as counts}

\item{funDat}{Data frame with rows as species (same as spDat column names), columns as functional traits, elements as counts, measures, binary, etc.}

\item{method}{Available options include "bray", "gower", and "altGower". See \code{\link[vegan]{vegdist}} for details. Default is Bray-Curtis dissimilarity.}

\item{redund}{Redundancy calculation as difference from Simpson's D (R = D - Q) or uniqueness (U = Q/D). Default is difference (TRUE).}
}
\value{
A data frame with rows as sites and a column of functional redundancy
}
\description{
The function calculates functional redundancy as Simpson's D minus dissimilarity between species weighted by the proportions of the species.
