\title{Functional Redundancy}

\usage{funredun(spDat, funDat, method = "bray", redund = TRUE, funDiv = FALSE)}

\arguments{
\item{spDat}{Data frame with rows as sites, columns as species, and elements as counts}
\item{funDat}{Data frame with rows as species (same as spDat column names), columns as functional traits, elements as counts, measures, binary, etc.}
\item{method}{Available options include "bray", "gower", and "altGower". See \code{\link[vegan]{vegdist}} for details. Default is Bray-Curtis dissimilarity.}
\item{redund}{Redundancy calculation as difference from Simpson's D (R = D - Q) or uniqueness (U = Q/D). Default is difference (TRUE).}
\item{funDiv}{Functional diversity as Rao's Q (Botta-Dukát 2005). Default is FALSE.}
}

\value{A data frame with rows as sites and a column of functional redundancy (includes a column of functional diversity if option selected).}
